            <h3>Octavia Butler</h3>

            <p class="funParagraph">Parable of the Sower and its sequel, Parable of the Talents, follow the journey of Lauren Olamina as she escapes a plague causing people to kill each other. 
               All while having hyperempathy that forces her to feel the pain of every person she sees. Lauren and I have the same birthday and the book begins 
               on our shared birthday this year: July 20th, 2024. I personally believe that Octavia Butler left us so many keys and clues in this book; observations of
               our society and the cycles we're bound to repeat. She died before she could write the third book of this series.

            <h2>Slaughterhouse Five</h2>
            <h3>Kurt Vonnegut</h3>
            <img class="left bordered" src = "/images/Slaughterhouse Five.jpeg" alt = "Slaughterhouse Five Cover" width="300" height="400">
            <p class="funParagraph">Kurt Vonnegut is the REALEST author I have ever read. He is often discounted as an easy read and I agree that his style of writing is very easy to follow.
               However, I find that conceptually his books are quite complex and offer a commentary on our society that is often overlooked. He speaks freely about wars fought by children, 
               calls out the injustices in our goverment, and discusses the dangers of greed and capitalism. He also offers a very intersting way of viewing death, the concept of time, and 
               alternate dimensions. "So it goes" is a phrase that offers an understanding that all time is occuring simultaneously and death is inevitable but doesn't signify anything other
               than the person is in a bad way at the current moment. Kurt Vonnegut died in 2007. I personally believe he would have had a field day writing about our current political sphere.

            <h2>The Lathe of Heaven</h2>
            <h3 id="caption">Ursula K. LeGuin</h3>
            <img class="right bordered" src = "/images/Lathe.webp" alt = "The Lathe of Heaven Cover" width="300" height="300">
            <p class="funParagraph">The Lathe of Heaven is a book I read and immediately went back to the beginning to reread it. This book is a whirlwind from start to finish. George Orr uses drugs to keep his "effective dreaming"
               at bay. His dreams cause changes to reality in ways no one else can comprehend. He begins seeing a doctor, Dr. Haber, who is supposed to help him stop dreaming like this but quickly realizes this doctor wants
               to use his power for greed and corruption. Dr. Haber is a well known and respected researcher and philanthropist who truly believes he's making the world better by using Orr's powers the way her does.
               Orr eventually realizes that while at face value many of his reality alterations improve the world, it also decreases the richness of culture that comes with variance and hardship. Ursula K. LeGuin
               explores some pretty intense concepts here: racism, alternative realities, over-population, cancer, and mental illness. Ursula K. Le Guin died just two years before COVID. I personally think she would have
               written some cool dystopian literature about the pandemic and its effects on our society.
