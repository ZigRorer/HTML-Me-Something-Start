            <h2>Parable of the Sower</h2>
            <h3> Octavia Butler</h3>
            <img src = "/images/Parable of the Sower.jpeg" alt = "Parable of the Sower Cover" width="450" height="450">
            <p>Parable of the Sower and its sequel, Parable of the Talents, follow the journey of Lauren Olamina as she escapes a plague causing people to kill each other. 
               All while having hyperempathy that forces her to feel the pain of every person she sees. Lauren and I have the same birthday and the book begins 
               on our shared birthday this year: July 20th, 2024. I personally believe that Octavia Butler left us so many keys and clues in this book; observations of
               our society and the cycles we're bound to repeat.

            <h2>Slaughterhouse Five</h2>
            <h3>Kurt Vonnegut</h3>
            <img src = "/images/Slaughterhouse Five.jpeg" alt = "Slaughterhouse Five Cover" width="417" height="555">
            <p>Kurt Vonnegut is the REALEST author I have ever read. He is often discounted as an easy read and I agree that his style of writing is very easy to follow.
               However, I find that conceptually his books are quite complex and offer a commentary on our society that is often overlooked. He speaks freely about wars fought by children, 
               calls out the injustice
